# Chapter 1 - Introduction to .NET Aspire and Microservices

## Technical Requirements

In this chapter you need .NET 8 with the .NET Aspire workload, either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, Docker Desktop, and a Microsoft Azure subscription. Information about the installation is explained in this chapter, and in the readme file of the source code repository.

The code for this chapter can be found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Pragmatic-Microservices-With-CSharp-and-Azure.

In the ch01 folder, you’ll see the projects with the result of this chapter. You’ll see these folders:

- Aspire – this folder contains four projects created with a .NET Aspire template to run a .NET Aspire project including one service and a Web application.
- Azure – this folder contains the same four projects from the previous folder, enhanced by using an Azure resource.

See [Installation](../installation.md) on how to install Visual Studio, Docker Desktop...
