# Chapter 1 - Introduction to .NET Aspire and Microservices

## Technical Requirements

With Aspire 9, installing the `dotnet workload` for .NET Aspire is no longer required. Instead, the AppHost project needs to have the SDK referenced.

To use .NET Aspire 9, either .NET 8 or .NET 9 is required. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Jet Brains Rider,
as well as Docker Desktop and a Microsoft Azure subscription. Information about the installation is explained in this chapter.

The code for this chapter can be found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Pragmatic-Microservices-With-CSharp-and-Azure.

In the ch01 folder, you’ll see the projects with the result of this chapter. You’ll see these folders:

- Aspire – this folder contains four projects created with a .NET Aspire template to run a .NET Aspire project including one service and a Web application.
- Azure – this folder contains the same four projects from the previous folder, enhanced by using an Azure resource.

See [Installation](../installation.md) on how to install Visual Studio, Docker Desktop...

See [Run in local dev environment](../RunDevEnvironment.md) to run the solution locally deploying Azure resources.
